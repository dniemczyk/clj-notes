My notes on Clojure.

### What I used to teach myself Clojure

I found many of the following resouces very usefull in teaching myself
Clojure. If you are interested in Clojure, go read read one of those,
and if posible buy a copy:

* "Clojure for the Brave and True" by D. Higginbotham
* "Programming Clojure" by C. Emerick, B. Carper and C. Grand
